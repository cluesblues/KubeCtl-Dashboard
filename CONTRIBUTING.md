## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check if an enhancement is already logged [here](../../issues), as you might find out that you don't need to create one. 
When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

### Pull Requests
- Fork the project & clone locally. Follow the initial setup here.
- Create a branch, naming it either a feature or bug: git checkout -b feature/that-new-feature or bug/fixing-that-bug
- Code and commit your changes. Bonus points if you write a good commit message: git commit -m 'Add some feature'
- Push to the branch: git push origin feature/that-new-feature
- Create a pull request for your branch ðŸŽ‰
